# Diabetes prediction using different classification models

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have implemented randomized grid search to optimize a number of models. I have also performed some data analysis before training to get some better understanding of the data. 

## Dataset
I have performed the analysis over the diabetes dataset. [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Optimizing_models_using_Randomized_grid_search/blob/master/diabetes.csv)  
It has 8 input features like (pregnancies, glucose, bloodpressure, skinthickness, insulin, bmi, diabetespedigreefunction, age) and a outcome feature.

## Installation

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
